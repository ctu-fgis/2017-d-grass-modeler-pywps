GRASS modeler allows interactively creating, editing and managing models. It also allows user to define items and actions and to parameterize GRASS commands. User can export his model to Python script. 

This project consists of two parts:

 * Support parameterization and generate also UI into a Python script (see frozen branch [ui_support](https://github.com/ctu-yfsg/2017-d-grass-modeler-pywps/tree/ui_support))
 * Allow user also to export his model directly to PyWPS (a Python implementation of the Web Processing Service) script (master branch)
