GRASS modeler allows interactively creating, editing and managing models. It also allows user to define items and actions and to parameterize GRASS commands. User can export his model to Python script. 

The task of this project is to allow user also to export his model directly to PyWPS (a Python implementation of the Web Processing Service) script. 

There is also subtask in improving the current Python export - to generate also model UI.
